# Paysage reboot
Paysage, visual shared code playground. But mobile-first responsive, lower floor 'tap thing, edit thing' model, local offline by default.

Multiplayer, mobile-first live simple code playground. A reboot of Paysage (check Paysage here: https://github.com/jonathanperret/paysage). 

The goal is to allow anyone to build visual, custom interactive mini web things on a collaborative live playground : prototypes, custom mini-apps, art, visual experiments, etc.

# What was great about Paysage 
- multiplayer, collaborative
- (almost) live coding 
- playground can be shared using a simple URL
- flexible, malleable: teaching, workshops, tests, etc.
- relatively low floor, not real limits as it's JavaScript anyway
- quite simple sync model (last version win)

# Why a reboot?
- mobile first
- responsive (quick way to do it, give users *WV and *HV as environment global multiples to use, as in rect(0, 0, 10*WV, 10*HV)
- even lower floor using a 'tap thing, edit thing' model (that's where fabriq is really close!)
- local and offline by default: you can play offline as long as you want. The code is stored in indexedDB first, and synced later)
- download the files would great, so you can prototype and then just keep a local version
- make text editing live and collaborative (text editor window use a OTT-ready existing editor)
